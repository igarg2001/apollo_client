# Apollo tutorial

This is the fullstack app for the [Apollo tutorial](http://apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction.html). ðŸš€

## File structure

The app is split out into two folders:
- `start`: Starting point for the tutorial
- `final`: Final version

From within the `start` and `final` directories, there are two folders (one for `server` and one for `client`).
